# Project Description (70%)
My project aim was to create a 2-D Game that is similar to Mario with incorporation of various game mechanics but focused on implementing Object Oriented Programming concepts in Java. The game is called "Pirate's Peril" and it features a player character that can move, jump, and interact with the environment. The game includes various levels, enemies, and collectibles. The project demonstrates the use of OOP concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and attributes, as well as concepts such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation among others. The program was aimed to improve on the concepts learnt from last semester to challenge myself to learn and apply something new.

## Evaluation Questions

Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability to show your understanding of the learning outcomes. Please provide examples from your project code to support your answers.


## Evaluation Material


### Q1. Algorithms

Algorithms are manyfold and Java can be used to program these. Examples are sorting or search strategies but also mathematical calculations. Please refer to **two** areas in either your regular coding practice (for example from Semester 1) or within your project, where you have coded an algorithm. Do not make reference to code written for other classes, like theoretical informatics.

https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/tree/main/Sorting%20Algorithms
I have done 2 algorithms, bubble sort and selection sort.

### Q2. Data types

Please explain the concept of data types and provide examples of different data types in Java.
typical data types in java are int, double, float, char, boolean, long, short, byte, String, and arrays. Please provide one example for each of the **four** following data types in your code.
* arrays
* Strings
* boolean
* your choice


* Arrays: They are a collection of elements of the same type. In Java, arrays are objects that can hold multiple values of a single type. For example, an array of integers can hold multiple integer values. https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Introduction/src/arrayIndex.java
 
* Strings: They are a sequence of characters that can be used to represent text. In Java, strings are objects that can hold multiple characters. For example, a string can hold a name or a sentence. https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Pirates%20Peril/src/utilz/LoadSave.java

* Boolean: It is a data type that can hold only two values, true or false. In Java, boolean is used to represent logical values. For example, a boolean variable can be used to check if a condition is true or false. https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Pirates%20Peril/src/utilz/HelpMethods.java

* int: It is a data type that can hold whole numbers. In Java, int is used to represent integer values. For example, an int variable can be used to store a person's age or a count of items.

### Q3. Complex Data Structures

Examples of complex data structures in java are ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, LinkedList, and TreeMap. Please provide an example of how you have used **two** of these complex data structures in your code and explain why you have chosen these data structures.

*https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/01%20Booking%20System/src/bookingSystem/GradeManager.java - to manage students and courses, I used HashMap to store the data in a key-value pair format. This allows for quick access to the data and makes it easy to manage the students and courses.

https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Introduction/src/arrayList.java Used ArrayList to create a List of String of fruits to the easily add fruits to the list.*

### Q4. Concepts of OOP
Concepts of OOP are the basic building blocks of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, methods, and attributes. 
Explain HOW and WHY your **project** demonstrates the use of OOP by using all of the following concepts:
* Classes/Objects https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Pirates%20Peril/src/main/Game.java 
* Methods https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Pirates%20Peril/src/main/GamePanel.java setPanelSize()
* Attributes https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Pirates%20Peril/src/main/Game.java int
Link to the code in your project that demonstrates what you have explained above.

*My code uses classes and objects to create a game where the player can interact with the environment. The methods are used to control the game flow and the attributes are used to store the state of the game. The code is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and maintain. Classes are used to create objects, attributes are the data and methods are like the behaviour tha performs an action. *

### Q5. OO Design
Please showcase **two** areas where you have used object orientation and explain the advantage that object oriented code brings to the application or the problem that your code is addressing.
Examples in java of good oo design are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 

https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Pirates%20Peril/src/main/Game.java
https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/blob/main/Pirates%20Peril/src/main/GamePanel.java

The advantage of object oriented code is that it allows for better organization of code, easier maintenance, and reusability of code. It also allows for better abstraction and encapsulation of data, which makes it easier to understand and work with.

### Q6. Testing
Java code is tested by using JUnit. Please explain how you have used JUnit in your project and provide a link to the code where you have used JUnit. Links do not have to refer to your project and can refer to your practice code. If you tested without JUnit, please explain how you tested your code.
Be detailed about what you are testing and how you argue for your test cases. 

Feel free to refer to the vibe coding session where you explored testing. (pair programming - you may link to your partner git and name him/her.)

Test cases usually cover the following areas:
* boundary cases
* normal cases
* error cases / catching exceptions

### Q7. Operator/Method Overloading
An example of operator overloading is the "+" operator that can be used to add two numbers or concatenate two strings. An example of method overloading is having two methods with the same name but different parameters. Please provide an example of how you have used operator or method overloading in your code and explain why you have chosen this method of coding.
The link does not have to be to your project and can be to your practice code.

### Q8. Templates/Generics
Generics in java are used to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on objects of specified types. Please provide an example of how you have used generics in your code and explain why you have chosen to use generics. The link does not have to be to your project and can be to your practice code.
https://github.com/s-panicker/java-programming/tree/main/Pirates%20Peril/src/gamestates
I used interfaces to create a generic class that can be used to show different game states.
